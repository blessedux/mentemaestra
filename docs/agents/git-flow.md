# Git flow for this repo

**Model**: trunk-based

**Promotion chain**: `main`

- **featureBase** (`main`) — new feature PRs (the output of `/ship-ticket`) target this branch.
- **deployTrigger** (`main`) — when a PR merges into this branch, the GitHub Action scaffolded by `/setup-merge-hook` transitions any linked Tickets from `QA` to `DONE`.

## How skills use this file

- `/ship-ticket` reads `featureBase` to set the base branch of new PRs.
- `/setup-merge-hook` reads `deployTrigger` to set the `on.pull_request.branches` filter for the GitHub Action.
- The Action scans **Rollup PRs** (PRs that promote work between chain nodes) for child PR references in commit messages so Tickets linked to feature PRs are still promoted when their work reaches the deployTrigger through the chain.
